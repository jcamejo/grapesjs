Default: `true`\n * @property {Boolean} [hoverable=true] Shows a highlight outline when hovering on the element if `true`. Default: `true`\n * @property {Boolean} [void=false] This property is used by the HTML exporter as void elements don't have closing tags, eg. `<br/>`, `<hr/>`, etc. Default: `false`\n * @property {String} [content=''] Content of the component (not escaped) which will be appended before children rendering. Default: `''`\n * @property {String} [icon=''] Component's icon, this string will be inserted before the name (in Layers and badge), eg. it can be an HTML string '<i class=\"fa fa-square-o\"></i>'. Default: `''`\n * @property {String|Function} [script=''] Component's javascript. More about it [here](/modules/Components-js.html). Default: `''`\n * @property {String|Function} [script-export=''] You can specify javascript available only in export functions (eg. when you get the HTML).\n * If this property is defined it will overwrite the `script` one (in export functions). Default: `''`\n * @property {Array<Object|String>} [traits=''] Component's traits. More about it [here](/modules/Traits.html). Default: `['id', 'title']`\n * @property {Array<String>} [propagate=[]] Indicates an array of properties which will be inhereted by all NEW appended children.\n *  For example if you create a component likes this: `{ removable: false, draggable: false, propagate: ['removable', 'draggable'] }`\n *  and append some new component inside, the new added component will get the exact same properties indicated in the `propagate` array (and the `propagate` property itself).

which you'll probably use to customize the editor or extend it with plugins.\n * You get the Editor instance on init method and you can pass options via its [Configuration Object](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/blob/master/src/editor/config/config.js)\n *\n * ```js\n * const editor = grapesjs.init({\n *    // options\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ## Available Events\n *\n * You can make use of available events in this way\n * ```js\n * editor.on('EVENT-NAME', (some, argument) => {\n *    // do something\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * ### Components\n * * `component:create` - Component is created (only the model, is not yet mounted in the canvas), called after the init() method\n * * `component:mount` - Component is mounted to an element and rendered in canvas\n * * `component:add` - Triggered when a new component is added to the editor, the model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:remove` - Triggered when a component is removed, the model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:clone` - Triggered when a component is cloned, the new model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:update` - Triggered when a component is updated (moved, styled, etc.), the model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:update:{propertyName}` - Listen any property change, the model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:styleUpdate` - Triggered when the style of the component is updated, the model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:styleUpdate:{propertyName}` - Listen for a specific style property change, the model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:selected` - New component selected, the selected model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:deselected` - Component deselected, the deselected model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:toggled` - Component selection changed, toggled model is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:type:add` - New component type added, the new type is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `component:type:update` - Component type updated, the updated type is passed as an argument to the callback\n * ### Blocks\n * * `block:add` - New block added\n * * `block:remove` - Block removed\n * * `block:drag:start` - Started dragging block, model of the block is passed as an argument\n * * `block:drag` - Dragging block, the block's model and the drag event are passed as arguments\n * * `block:drag:stop` - Dragging of the block is stopped. As agruments for the callback you get, the dropped component model (if dropped successfully) and the model of the block\n * ### Assets\n * * `asset:add` - New asset added\n * * `asset:remove` - Asset removed\n * * `asset:upload:start` - Before the upload is started\n * * `asset:upload:end` - After the upload is ended\n * * `asset:upload:error` - On any error in upload, passes the error as an argument\n * * `asset:upload:response` - On upload response, passes the result as an argument\n * ### Keymaps\n * * `keymap:add` - New keymap added. The new keyamp object is passed as an argument\n * * `keymap:remove` - Keymap removed. The removed keyamp object is passed as an argument\n * * `keymap:emit` - Some keymap emitted, in arguments you get keymapId, shortcutUsed, Event\n * * `keymap:emit:{keymapId}` - `keymapId` emitted, in arguments you get keymapId, shortcutUsed, Event\n * ### Style Manager\n * * `styleManager:update:target` - The target (Component or CSSRule) is changed\n * * `styleManager:change` - Triggered on style property change from new selected component, the view of the property is passed as an argument to the callback\n * * `styleManager:change:{propertyName}` - As above but for a specific style property\n * ### Storages\n * * `storage:start` - Before the storage request is started\n * * `storage:start:store` - Before the store request.

To illustrate this concept let's take\n * a look at this code:\n *\n * ```css\n * span > #send-btn.btn{\n *  ...\n * }\n * ```\n * ```html\n * <span>\n *   <button id=\"send-btn\" class=\"btn\"></button>\n * </span>\n * ```\n *\n * In this scenario we get:\n * * span     -> selector of type `tag`\n * * send-btn -> selector of type `id`\n * * btn      -> selector of type `class`\n *\n * So, for example, being `btn` the same class entity it'll be easier to refactor and track things.\n *\n * You can customize the initial state of the module from the editor initialization, by passing the following [Configuration Object](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/blob/master/src/selector_manager/config/config.js)\n * ```js\n * const editor = grapesjs.init({\n *  selectorManager: {\n *    // options\n *  }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Once the editor is instantiated you can use its API. Before using these methods you should get the module from the instance\n *\n * ```js\n * const selectorManager = editor.SelectorManager;\n * ```\n *\n * * [getConfig](#getconfig)\n * * [add](#add)\n * * [addClass](#addclass)\n * * [get](#get)\n * * [getAll](#getAll)\n *\n * @module SelectorManager\n */\n\nimport { isString, isElement, isObject, isArray } from 'underscore';\nimport defaults from './config/config';\nimport Selector from './model/Selector';\nimport Selectors from './model/Selectors';\nimport ClassTagsView from './view/ClassTagsView';\n\nconst isId = str => isString(str) && str[0] == '#';\nconst isClass = str => isString(str) && str[0] == '.';\n\nexport default config => {\n  var c = config || {};\n  var selectors, selectorTags;\n\n  return {\n    Selector,\n\n    Selectors,\n\n    /**\n     * Name of the module\n     * @type {String}\n     * @private\n     */\n    name: 'SelectorManager',\n\n    /**\n     * Get configuration object\n     * @return {Object}\n     */\n    getConfig() {\n      return c;\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Initialize module.
